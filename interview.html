<b>Recruitment, training and career development
</b><br><br>
DST has continually recruited many people not only a person who has high experiences ,but also new graduated student and under graduate student. To apply for this job in the company, the student can send their resume or CV to the company’s email. Many training courses are provided within the organization such as English skills. He obtained the opportunities to join the company by sending resume to DST people in the SIT career day at the university. However, the university did not provide Cobol and JCL programming in depth, so he needs to learn by himself. Therefore, He advises if someone interested in this job, they should practice Cobol and JCL programing language skills because it uses a lot in this job in this company. 


</p>
<p id="textleft">
<b>Rewards and Frustrations

</b><br><br>
The company supports employees by providing medical and dental care. Many rewards which help employees maintain high-performance work environment is also provided, for example, Supplemental life insurance for yourself, spouse, or domestic partner Moreover dental and medical care is included. The most reason that made him feel uncomfortable with this job is that the requirements usually change because of customer’s needs. Therefore, to meet new requirements and get work done take a lot of time. In contrast, He is able to show his ideas to improve performance of work which make him feel free to share his thoughts.

<b>Personal skills needed


</b><br><br>
In this type of job, He needs to deal with a lot of customers. He thinks the most personal skills that will contribute the most success are being responsible, adaptable and self-learner. First of all, responsibility, getting work done on time is needed ,and being confident to accept mistakes that they made. Second, a person who works in this job should be adaptable. Since the technologies change rapidly these days, they should learn and apply new things if it is better than the old one. Finally, The most important skill is to be self-learner. In the workplace, no one is going to teach you everything. Most of the times they need to learn by themselves to improve their skills. 


</p>
<p id="textleft">
<b>Would you do this work?


</b><br><br>
After the informational interview, I realized that being a dedicated support programmer is quite hard for me, and it needs a lot of patience because programmers have to communicate with many clients in order to build a single application. Also, I am lack of many hard skills, for example, JCL and Cobol. Therefore, I may not be suitable in this type of job because I am weak at Cobol and JCL because the university does not provide both of these programming language courses. In addition, I am now interested in building new things not fixing something such as IOS or android developer.
